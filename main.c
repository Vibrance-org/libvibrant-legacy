     * once RandR parses the data. Therefore, pad the blob_data to be long-

     * it's at least 32-bits).
     *
     * Note that we have a 32-bit format restriction; we have to interpret
     * each S31.32 fixed point number within the CTM in two parts: The
     * whole part (S31), and the fractional part (.32). They're then stored
     * (as separate parts) into a long-typed array. Of course, This problem
     * wouldn't exist if xserver accepted 64-bit formats.
     *
     * A gotcha here is the endianness of the S31.32 values. The whole part
     * will either come before or after the fractional part. (before in
     * big-endian format, and after in small-endian format). We could avoid
     * dealing with this by doing a straight memory copy, but we have to
     * ensure that each 32-bit element is padded to long-size in the
